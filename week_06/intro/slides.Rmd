#What is R?  

#R is an environment.  

## R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.  
* From the [R homepage](https://www.r-project.org/about):

## R is 
* an effective data handling and storage facility  
* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices  
* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis  
* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy and  
* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.  

## The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.  

##So many ways to learn R  
* [The manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf)  
* Books -- My favorite is [The Art of R Programming](https://archive.org/details/Norman_Matloff___The_Art_of_R_Programming) by Norman Matloff  
* Online courses/tutorials -- Any recommendations?  
* Learn R in R with the [swiRl](http://swirlstats.com/) package  
* **In this course!**

# Base R  

## Beyond base

You seem to be falling prey to a common misconception that "R" is some monolithic tool, when in fact it is a herd of cats.  
   -- Jeff Newmiller (in response to a user who did not look for packages)
      R-help (December 2013)  

* R has packages that are easy to install and call upon  

## Anyone is allowed to make an R package  
* There are 7,801 R packages available on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)  
* Whatever you are doing, some one has probably made an R package that can help you  
* Packages from CRAN are very well-documented, although sometimes it is tough to get through the jargon  
* It is often useful to use two forms of documentation

## Some examples  
  * [nlme](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme/nlme.pdf) (more stats) 
  * [agricolae](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/agricolae/agricolae.pdf)  (stats for agronomy)  
  * [soilR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SoilR/SoilR.pdf) (soil carbon modeling)  
  * [meteo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meteo/meteo.pdf) (spatial modeling)  
  * [apsimR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apsimr/index.html) (run another program from R)  
  * [tidyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)  
  * [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html)  
  Many packages are not on CRAN --  e.g. [metagenomeSeq](http://cbcb.umd.edu/software/metagenomeSeq)  

## Whenever you think something can't be done in R, a new package seems to come out.

R can probaby do anything, but it doesn't mean it's always the best (or fastest) at everything.  

# How are we expected to keep up with all these packages?

## Follow the R community  
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd), even if you join for this reason  #rstats  
* [R weekly](https://rweekly.org/)  
* [R Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)  
* UseR Conference if you really get into it  

## Find R users in your own discipline, at your own conferences  
* Sometimes there are R meetings before the conference begins  
* Keep an eye out for figures made in ggplot2, read poster methods sections  

## Search and ask a lot of questions  
* Google  
* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)  
* [R-Help](http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/) is also out there, but I don't use it  
* Talk to people face-to-face, more than just one person  
* Join/start an R group  

# Before you know it, you will *be* the R community  

## The remainder of the semester will be learning how to do things in R  
* Basics  
* Data wrangling  
* Data visualization  
* Scraping data from the web  
* Let us know of specific needs/interests
