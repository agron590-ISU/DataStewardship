#What is R?  

#R is an environment.  

## R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.  
* From the [R homepage](https://www.r-project.org/about):

## R is 
* an effective data handling and storage facility  
* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices  
* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis  
* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy and  
* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.  

## The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.  

##So many ways to learn R  
* [The manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf)  
* Books -- My favorite is [The Art of R Programming](https://archive.org/details/Norman_Matloff___The_Art_of_R_Programming) by Norman Matloff  
* Online courses/tutorials -- Any recommendations?  
* Learn R in R with the [swiRl](http://swirlstats.com/) package  
* **In this course!**

# Base R  

## Beyond base

You seem to be falling prey to a common misconception that "R" is some monolithic tool, when in fact it is a herd of cats.
   -- Jeff Newmiller (in response to a user who did not look for packages)
      R-help (December 2013)  

* R has packages that are easy to install and call upon  

## Anyone is allowed to make an R package  
* There are 7,801 R packages available on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)  
* Whatever you are doing, some one has probably made an R package that can help you
