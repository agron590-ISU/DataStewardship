## Let's make an `R` package!

<img src="images/book_cover.png" height=475px />

Content for today is from [Hadley's book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) and Eric's ISU Graphics Group talk. 

## Why Packages?

- Easy to install compared to sourcing in `R` scripts
- Dependency tracking (e.g., `dplyr` requires `magrittr` for the pipe operator, etc.)
- Package versioning
- Documentation is much easier
- Sharing with others via CRAN, GitHub
- Makes **reproducibility** a little cleaner/easier

## Requirements

2. devtools (`install.packages("devtools")`)
3. roxygen2 (`install.packages("roxygen2")`)

Some other potentially useful packages include:

- testthat (`install.packages("testthat")`) - Allows the writing of unit tests for individual functions
- knitr (`install.packages("knitr")`) and rmarkdown (`install.packages("rmarkdown")`) for building vignettes

## Ready?

We can check:

```{r}
library(devtools)

has_devel()
```

## Naming your Package

From http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html:

- Pick a unique name you can easily Google.
- Avoid using both upper and lower case letters
- Find a word that evokes the problem and modify it so that itâ€™s unique:
    - tidyr tidies data in `R`
    - lubridate makes dates and times easier.
- Add an r to the end of a word

## The DESCRIPTION File

This is the overall descriptor of the package from which metadata is obtained. Fields include:

- Package: agron590demo
- Type: Package
- Title: What the Package Does (Title Case)
- Version: 0.1.0
- Author: Who wrote it
- Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
- Description: More about what it does

And more...

## The NAMESPACE File

Defines the imported functions (dependencies), and exported functions

What are exported functions?

- Functions that are made available to the user
- These contrast from internal functions which are not meant to be accessed by users of your package
- `::` vs `:::`

## The R Directory

Contains the `R` code for the package. This can be done in a few ways:

1. Put all functions into a single file
2. Have a separate file for each function
3. Group similar functions together in separate files

The third is recommended by Hadley and is generally the approach that should be used, although CRAN gatekeepers prefer the second option at least compared with the first.

## The man Directory

- Stands for "Manual"
- Contains ".Rd" files (`R` Documentation) which define the help files we know and love
- Very ugly structure
- Each (exported) function should have an Rd file associated with it.
- Luckily, we don't have to manually edit this...

## `roxygen2`

It allows automatic generation of:

- All exports
- All imports
- All Rd files

It creates the NAMESPACE and Rd files automatically for us. We just have to add special comments above each function.

Let's take a look...

## Checking, Installing, Building

There will be three general routines we use `devtools` for: checking (verifying that the package is in the proper format), installing (installing it on our own computer), and building (building it for use by other people)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# With your working directory set to the root package folder
devtools::check()
devtools::install()
devtools::build()
```

## Package Dependencies

Sometimes we need to depend on other packages. To do so, we use the @import or @importFrom directive in roxygen. Let's look at an example.

<p style="color:white">
Add a new function of your choosing to the package. The function must:
</p>

<ol style="color:white">
<li>Import the `ggplot2` package (`@import ggplot2`)</li>
<li>Return a ggplot2 plot of your choosing</li>
<li>Be exported</li>
<li>Take at least two parameters which are both documented</li>
</ol>
<p style="color:white">
When you have created this function, **check** and **install** your package to make sure that it works!
</p>

## GitHub

In the real world, we're usually developing packages with other developers. Collaborative coding tools like GitHub make this much easier.

As a side benefit, putting your package on GitHub makes **installing** the package much easier as well:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("andeek/agron590demo")
```
