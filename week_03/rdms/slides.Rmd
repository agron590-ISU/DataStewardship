# It's all relative

## What is a database?

- An organized collection of data organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information.
- A *relational database* is a database whose organization is based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.
- Most relational database systems use *SQL* (Structured Query Language) as the language for querying and maintaining the database.

## Motivation

- Do you have multiple spreadsheets that are **related**?
- Do you have multiple tabs in a spreadsheet that are **related**?
- Do you have a gigantic spreadsheet (> 1M rows) that freezes Excel when you open it?
- Do you have a slowly changing spreadsheet that you want to keep track of?

## Relational Model

- A database consists of a series of unordered tables (or relations) that can be manipulated using operations that return tables.
- **Purpose:** provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries.
- Users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it.

## Design (more later)

Unless you walk into a project with a database already in production, you will probably have to design one yourself. You have to make decisions about

- what tables to create,
- what columns they contain, and
- what are the relationships between tables.

This is usually not easy and takes time and effort.

We will talk more about strategies for this later (week 5).

# Tables and keys

## Tables
- Tables represent "things" in the real world.
- Each table should only represent one "thing"
- A "thing" can be an object or an event
    - e.g. Customers, students, locations, sample
- Tables are made up of rows and columns
- Can imagine a table is *kind of* like a spreadsheet of data
    
## Uniqueness

- Each row must be **unique** in a table
    - This helps us avoid confusion in our tables
- Can guarantee uniqueness by assigning a key to a row

## Primary keys
- Each table can have only one *primary key* 
- All columns (or combination of columns) in a table with unique values are referred to as *candidate keys* 
- Keys can be *simple* or *composite*
    - **simple key** made up of one column
    - **composite key** made up of two or more columns
- You choose this in design phase of a DB (no right answer)
    - choose the fewest columns necessary
    - choose a key that seldom changes
    - choose a key that is both simple and familiar to users

## Foreign keys

- Primary keys are functions of individual tables
- When you create relationships between tables, need a way to **join** multiple tables together
- A *foreign key* is a column in a table used to reference a primary key in another table

# Relationships

## One-to-one

## One-to-many

## Many-to-many
