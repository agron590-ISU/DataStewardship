# It's all relative

## What is a database?

- An organized collection of data organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information.
- A *relational database* is a database whose organization is based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.
- Most relational database systems use *SQL* (Structured Query Language) as the language for querying and maintaining the database.

## Motivation

- Do you have multiple spreadsheets that are **related**?
- Do you have multiple tabs in a spreadsheet that are **related**?
- Do you have a gigantic spreadsheet (> 1M rows) that freezes Excel when you open it?
- Do you have a slowly changing spreadsheet that you want to keep track of?

## Relational Model

- A database consists of a series of unordered tables (or relations) that can be manipulated using operations that return tables.
- **Purpose:** provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries.
- Users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it.

## Design (more later)

Unless you walk into a project with a database already in production, you will probably have to design one yourself. You have to make decisions about

- what tables to create,
- what columns they contain, and
- what are the relationships between tables.

This is usually not easy and takes time and effort.

We will talk more about strategies for this later.

# Tables and keys

## Uniqueness

## Primary keys

## Foreign keys

# Relationships

## One-to-one

## One-to-many

## Many-to-many

# Normalization

## Normal forms

## First normal form

## Second normal form

## Third normal form

## Breaking the rules:  when to denormalize
