##Models 

<center><img src="images/inception_top.gif" width="800px"/></center>

##Why model?  
* Modeling helps you identify trends, make predictions, and perform statistical tests  
* Today we will only touch on modeling and do so in the context of tools we have already learned  

We will be discussing Chapter 23 of [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham

##Modeling for EDA  
* Use models to partition data into patterns and residuals  
* Strong patterns will hide subtler trends, use models to peel back layers of structure as you explore a dataset  

##Very, very, very basics of how models work  
First, define a *family of models* that express a precise, but generic, pattern that you want to capture.  

* For example, a straight line expressed `y = a_1 * x + a_2` 
* `x` and `y` are known variable from your data and `a_1` and `a_2` are parameters that can vary to capture different patterns  

##Very, very, very basics of how models work  
Next, generate a *fitted model* by finding the model from the family that is the closest to your data.  

* This takes the generic model family and makes it specific, like `y = 3 * x + 7`.  

A fitted model is just the closest model from a family of models. This does not necessarily mean it is good and does not imply the model is "true".
