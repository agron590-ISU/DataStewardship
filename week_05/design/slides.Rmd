# Normalization

## Relationship vs. Attribute

An attribute can hide a relationship and relationships can be "downgraded" to an attribute.

## Normal forms

*Normalization* is a relational database concept that describes the shapes of tables and rules that tables must follow. If you have created a "normalized" entity-relationship data model, then the tables created during design will conform to the rules of normalization.

## First normal form (1NF)

- All attributes must be single-valued. Under first normal form, all occurrences of a record type must contain the same number of fields.
- First normal form excludes variable repeating fields and groups.
- If the attribute has multiple values, create an additional entity and relate it to the original entity with a m:1 relationship.

## Second normal form (2NF) and Third normal form (3NF)

- (2NF) An attribute must be dependent upon its entityâ€™s entire unique identifier.
    - Second normal form is violated when an attribute is a fact about a subset of a key. 
    - It is only relevant when the key is composite.
- (3NF) An attribute depends on nothing outside the primary key.
    - Third normal form is violated when an attribute is a fact about another attribute field

## Fourth (4NF) & fifth (5NF) normal forms

Usually **3NF is enough** when modeling real data. 

- 4NF and 5NF deal with multivalued (independent) attributes.
    - *Independence* between attributes means there is no direct connection between the two. There is only an indirect connection because they belong to some common entity.
- 4NF states that an entity should only contain at most 1 independent multivalued attribute and satisfy 3NF.
- 5NF posits an entity's information content cannot be reconstructed from several smaller entities.
