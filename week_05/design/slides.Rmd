# Normalization and other tricks

## Relationship vs. Attribute

An attribute can hide a relationship and relationships can be "downgraded" to an attribute.

## Normal forms

*Normalization* is a relational database concept that describes the shapes of tables and rules that tables must follow. If you have created a "normalized" entity-relationship data model, then the tables created during design will conform to the rules of normalization.

## First normal form (1NF)

- All attributes must be single-valued. Under first normal form, all occurrences of a record type must contain the same number of fields.
- First normal form excludes variable repeating fields and groups.
- If the attribute has multiple values, create an additional entity and relate it to the original entity with a m:1 relationship.

## Second normal form (2NF) and Third normal form (3NF)

- (2NF) An attribute must be dependent upon its entityâ€™s entire unique identifier.
    - Second normal form is violated when an attribute is a fact about a subset of a key. 
    - It is only relevant when the key is composite.
- (3NF) An attribute depends on nothing outside the primary key.
    - Third normal form is violated when an attribute is a fact about another attribute field

## Fourth (4NF) & fifth (5NF) normal forms

Usually **3NF is enough** when modeling real data. 

- 4NF and 5NF deal with multivalued (independent) attributes.
    - *Independence* between attributes means there is no direct connection between the two. There is only an indirect connection because they belong to some common entity.
- 4NF states that an entity should only contain at most 1 independent multivalued attribute and satisfy 3NF.
- 5NF posits an entity's information content cannot be reconstructed from several smaller entities.

## Modeling change

Every update of an attribute or transfer of a relationship means potential loss of information. Often that information is no longer of use, but some systems need to keep track of some or all of the old values of an attribute. This may lead to an explicit time
dimension in the model.

## Types of change

- Often it is natural to record a date attribute, usually when an entity is an event. E.g., when an experiment was run, when a sample was collected, when a purchase was made.
- Sometimes adding a date attribute allows you to work in the **future**, if you know an event will happen
- Maybe values can be updated, but you want to keep track of some of the old values.
    - `start_date` and `end_date`

As always, there is a price for adding things such as this. Adding a time dimension to your conceptual data model makes the model considerably more complex. Think **constraints**.

## Slowly changing dimensions

- Overwrite (no history saved)
- Add a new row with effective dates
- Add a new attribute with current vs. old
- Add history table

## Learning is easy, doing is hard

What are some lessons I can give you about actually doing this?

1. Draw an ERD
    - Start with entities, then think about relationships, then add attributes
    - Think about the *granularity* of your tables (What does one row of data represent?)
    - Are you missing (dropping) any pieces of data?
2. Edit your ERD, explain it to a (imaginary?) friend
3. Think about some questions you have to answer with your data. Can you answer those questions?
4. How difficult will it be for your database to adapt? Can you make it more flexible now?
