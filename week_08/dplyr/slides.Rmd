## `dplyr`, your new best f`R`iend

![](images/best_friends.gif)

## Motivation

There is a dataset in the `plyr` package that has yearly batting records for major league baseball players from 1871 to 2007.

```{r}
data(baseball, package="plyr")
head(baseball)
```

## Your turn { .cover .white }

<p style="color: white">
Write a for loop that calculates and stores the career batting average for each player (note, batting average is number of hits, `h`, divided by number of at bats, `ab`, in a player's career.)
</p>
<p style="color: white">
<b>Hint:</b> You can get the unique player ids using the following:
</p>

```{r}
players <- unique(baseball$id)
```

## How did it go?

- Household chores (declaring variables, setting values each time) distract from real work
- Indices are error-prone
- Loops often result in slow code because R can compute quantities using entire vectors in an optimized way

## Enter: `dplyr`

`dplyr` is a Hadley package that implements the "split-apply-combine" strategy (among other things).

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

## Verbs

- When working with data you must:
    1. Figure out what you want to do.
    1. Describe those tasks in the form of a computer program.
    1. Execute the program.


`dplyr` provides simple **verbs**, functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks, to help you translate those thoughts into code.

## Group by

- `group_by()` breaks down a dataset into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs on the resulting object theyâ€™ll be automatically applied "by group"
- This is the **split** part of the split-apply-combine strategy
- This is the same operator that we used in SQL, `GROUP BY`

```{r}
group_by(baseball, id)
```
## Summarise

- `summarise()` summarises data through the use of aggregate functions, which take a vector of values and return a single number. 
- There are many useful examples of such functions, `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`, `sum()`, `sd()`, `median()`, and `IQR()`. 

```{r}
summarise(baseball, mean(h))
summarise(group_by(baseball, year), mean(h))
```

 

## The pipe

The pipe operator in `dplyr` actually comes from a package called `magrittr`, and is meant to simplify your code into readable, sequential operators (almost like stringing together actions into a story).


```r
x %>% f()
```

The above code can be read as "Take `x`, **and then** do `f`". The `%>%` operator takes whatever is to the left of it and plugs it in as the first argument in the function to the right. So, this is equivalent to

```r
f(x)
```

## The Treachery of Images

This allows you to string together operations sequentially.

```{r, message=FALSE}
baseball %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarise(ba = mean(h/ab)) %>% 
  tail(2)
```
