#The Role of Dynamic Documents in Reproduciblity  

##What is a dynamic document?  
* A dynamic document incorporates changes made in your work as you work.  
* Your data changes, your document changes.  
* Your code changes, your document changes.  
* Your story changes, your document changes. . .if you type in the new story.

##Research has many moving parts  
* Text for the story  
* Data  
    - Many years  
    - Many people  
    - Many types  
    - Many sets  
* Code  
    - Figures, tables  
    - Statistical analysis  
* Software   
* Bibliography

When you start a publication, you don't always have a map of where you're going. This usually means you also can't provide a map of where you've been, even if you can give someone directions on how to get there.

## A dynamic document is more than just a pretty face.  
* Dynamic documents can tie together everything you have done and allow others to reproduce all or part of your work.  
* A good dynamic document requires thoughtful structuring behind the scenes.  

## Dynamic documents are not a new idea.  
When I was playing Oregon Trail, people were planning ways to tie together their text, code, and data in a way that they would not have to repeat work and others could follow what they did.

Probably so they could keep track of their Oregon Trail successes and failures.

## Compendium  
  Gentleman and Lang introduce the idea of a *compendium* as both  
  
* a container for the elements that make up a publication  
* a means for distributing, managing, and updating the collection.  

Key Words: Compendium, Dynamic documents, Literate programming, Markup language, Perl, Python, R  

## Compendium  
* Elements of a dynamic document can be extracted and processed by both the author and the reader  
* Elements of the compendium can be used in contexts other than the author's original work    


## Compendium Elements    
Gentleman and Lang define a dynamic document as an ordered composition of code chunks and text chunks.  

* *Code chunks* are sequences of commands in some programming language.  
    - Perform the computations needed to produce the appropriate output  
* *Text chunks* describe the problem, the code, the results, and often their interpretation.  
* *Auxiliary software* is software that is used, but does not appear in the dynamic document.  For example, R packages and functions.  
* *Transformer* is the mechansism or system used to transform a dynamic document into some desired output.
