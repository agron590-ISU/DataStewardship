% I try to make sure that students who would like to attend office hours have that ability. If none of these times fit your course schedule, additional office hours can be arranged. You can also ask questions through emails at any time - I check my email frequently and emails will generally be answered within 24 hours (except on weekends). However, I may not respond immediately - so it is in your best interest not to wait until the last minute before homework deadlines or exams.

\noindent\textbf{Attendance}:  
Grades do not directly depend on attendance - still, experience shows that attendance and course performance are significantly related to each other. In order to get the most out of this course and do his or her personal best, it is necessary for a student to treat attendance as if it were mandatory.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Academic Honesty}:  
As an Iowa State University student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy (http://www.dso.iastate.edu/ja/academic/misconduct.html).
Academic misconduct is a serious matter and student's suspected of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Students Office.
Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.
