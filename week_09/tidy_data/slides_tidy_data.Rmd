## Tibbles  
  Like a dataframe, but does less 
  
  * Never changes the type of inputs  
  * Never changes the names of variables  
  * Never creates row names  
  * Is not as picky about column names (accepts spaces or names beginning with numbers)  
      - These must be surrounded by backticks  
      
## Tibbles  
  When you print a tibble, you see  
  
  * First 10 rows  
  * Type of column
  * Only the columns that fit on the screen (other columns listed)  
      - If you want to see all the columns use `width = Inf`.  
  
## Tidy data  

 <center><img src="images/tidy_1.png" width="800px" /></center>  
 
 * Each variable must have its own column.    
 * Each observation must have its own row.  
 * Each value must have its own cell.  

## Why tidy data  

* Consistent data structure allows easier learning of related tools because they have an underlying uniformity  
* Placing variables in columns takes advantage of R's vectorized nature  
* ggplot2 and dplyr are best friends with tidy data  

##  Very easy to find data that is well organized, but not tidy 

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE }
df<-data.frame(property=c("pH", "NO3", "clay", "silt", "sand"),
                    five_cm = c(7, 35, 20, 20, 60),
                    ten_cm = c(6.7, 22, 20, 20, 60),
                    fifteen_cm = c(6.5, 20, 20, 20, 60),
                    twenty_cm = c(6.4, 18, 20, 20, 60),
                   stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

soil<-as_tibble(df)
soil
```

Plot the change in pH across depth?

##  `gather`  
When column names are *values* instead of variables, we need to `gather` 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
soil
```

* We need to know the columns that are the values that need to be incorporated  
* The name of the variable for the values, here it is `depth`. This can be called the `key`.  


##  `gather`  
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
soil
```

> * The name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells. This can be called `value`. If you know what it is, name it (NO3ppm). If you have many mixed units, you can use `value = value` or `value = measured` etc.

## `gather`  
```{r}
tidy_soil<-gather(soil, five_cm, ten_cm, fifteen_cm, twenty_cm, key=depth, value=value)
tidy_soil
```

##  
```{r}
filter(tidy_soil, property == "pH")%>%
ggplot(aes(x=depth, y=value))+
  geom_point(size=3)
```
Almost!  

##  `spread`

Use this if one of your columns is full of what could be headers
```{r, echo=FALSE}
crops<-read_csv("data/NASS-Iowa.csv")
oats<-(crops[crops$Commodity == "OATS", c(2, 16, 17, 20)])  
head(oats)
```

* Now column that includes the variable names is `key`, here it is `Data Item`.  
* Column that contains the values is the `value` column, here they already have it as `Values` 

##   
```{r}
spread(oats, key = `Data Item`, value = Value)
```

## 
```{r}
spread(oats, key = `Data Item`, value = Value)%>%
ggplot(aes(y=`OATS - YIELD, MEASURED IN BU / ACRE`,
           x = `OATS - ACRES HARVESTED`, label = Year))+
        geom_text()
```
