## Tibbles  
  Like a dataframe, but does less 
  
  * Never changes the type of inputs  
  * Never changes the names of variables  
  * Never creates row names  
  * Is not as picky about column names (accepts spaces or names beginning with numbers)  
      - These must be surrounded by backticks  
      
## Tibbles  
  When you print a tibble, you see  
  
  * First 10 rows  
  * Type of column
  * Only the columns that fit on the screen (other columns listed)  
      - If you want to see all the columns use `width = Inf`.  
  
## Tidy data

 * Each variable must have its own column.    
 * Each observation must have its own row.  
 * Each value must have its own cell.  

## Why tidy data  

* Consistent data structure allows easier learning of related tools because they have an underlying uniformity  
* Placing variables in columns takes advantage of R's vectorized nature  
* ggplot2 and dplyr are best friends with tidy data  

##  Very easy to find data that is well organized, but not tidy  
```{r, echo=FALSE}


```
